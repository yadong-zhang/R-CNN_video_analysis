# Understanding Recurrent Convolutional Neural Networks
Here’s a dataset that is designed to help showcase when a Recurrent Convolutional Neural Network (RCNN) will outperform its’ non-recurrent counterpart, the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).

[The dataset is also on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/zackakil/sliding-square-rcnn-toy-dataset)
